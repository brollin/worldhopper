shard: honor, cultivation
one large landmass, a pangea built up of crem, almost entirely in southern hemisphere
no other continents, only islands
has three moons: SALAS, NOMON, MISHIM all in unstable orbits

BRAIZE
shard: odium
cold, barren, inhospitable planet uninhabited except for splinters
also called Damnation
